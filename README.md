This repository is to recreate the work performed in the paper "Generation of Malware Samples Using Variational Autoencoders." 

The work is a continuation of the original work in Trehan, H., & Troia, F. D. (2021, December). Fake Malware Generation Using HMM and GAN. In Silicon Valley Cybersecurity Conference (pp. 3-21). Springer, Cham.
The code-20230116T073801Z-001.zip and images-20230116T073913Z-001.zip zip files contains the original work's files. 

The malware_data folder contains opcode sequences for malware families. Only a few samples are stored in this repository. More data can be obtained from Professor Fabio Di Troia at San Jose State University.  The benign_data.zip contains incomplete benign malware data.

The WGAN-GP folder contains the refactored model of the original to model to run on a desktop machine.

The VAE folder contains designs of two Dense VAEs and two CNN VAEs.

The Classifiers folder contains machine learning and deep learning classifiers. There is also a file to perform search algorithms for minimum samples to achieve a target accuracy.

The Utilities folder contains a Matlab file that generates avi files of malware images.
